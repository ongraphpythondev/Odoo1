Getting started with Odoo

-------------------------

IN ODOO we can do task like -:

1 - creating a free trial account on Odoo.

2-  Enable the developer mode to access more features.

3-Authenticate Odoo’s account using Python.

4- Use add, update, delete and read operations in Odoo using Odoo’s external APIs for Python.

5- Create a basic order management system to handle orders using Odoo and Python.



For a standard installation please follow the steps:-

1.Odoo requires Python 3.7 or later to run.During installation, check Add Python 3 to PATH, then click Customize Installation and make sure that pip is checked.

2.Odoo uses PostgreSQL as database management system.By default, the only user is postgres but Odoo forbids connecting as postgres, so you need to create a new PostgreSQL user.

3.Before installing the dependencies, you must download and install the Build Tools for Visual Studio.

4.Odoo dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file located at the root of the Odoo community directory.

RUNNING ODOO -:

Once all dependencies are set up, Odoo can be launched by running odoo-bin, the command-line interface of the server. It is located at the root of the Odoo Community directory.
